DURATION: AUGUST TO SEPTEMBER 2024
DOMAIN: CYBER SECURITY&ETHICAL HACKING

OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:

PROJECT:VULNERABILITY SCANNING TOOL.

**OBJECTIVES:
1. Common Vulnerabilities: Checks for the existence of a `robots.txt`.
2. SQL Injection: A simple way to test for SQL injection weaknesses and verify if parameters are appended to the URL with correct SQL payloads.
3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): To check for possible XSS vulnerabilities, we inject a list of payloads in the form of forged scripts.

Key Components: 
•	`set_url(URL)`: Sets the URL to be scanned. 
•	-` scan()`: It is responsible for starting the scan and collecting of vulnerabilities. 
•	`check_common_vulnerabilities()`: Searches for the existence of `robots.txt`. 
•	`check_sql_injection()`: Different payloads of SQL injection are tried. 
•	`check_xss()`: Used for testing cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

Error Handling: 
•	The scanner also implements simple forms of simple error handling for some network-related problems and outputs connection errors.

About the Program:
•	This program is almost a utility-like program in the command line interface type of environment and is used for security testing. It can be used by developers security researchers, or anybody who has an interest in configuring and examining the security of a web application. Using the URL entry, users will be in a position to know if there are simple vulnerabilities that may exist and need to be worked on. It is therefore good for the starting point for vulnerability assessment though this particular shouldn’t be used as an all-round security scanner. A deeper security analysis requires the use of other elaborate instruments and techniques.
